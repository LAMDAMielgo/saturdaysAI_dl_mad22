# saturdaysAI_dl_mad22

Content and practices from course done at [Saturdays.AI](!https://saturdays.ai/) **5th Ed** in Madrid for the **Deep Learning** path course.

The course is structured with content on their [Eduflow platform](!saturdays.eduflow.com) to review before each class and practices done in our own and then peer-reviewed through the platform

For each week there is an **individual practice** available and a **group challenge** that is done after the weekly class. 

Al the models done and the notebooks have been developed in google colab, making use of their free CPU.
